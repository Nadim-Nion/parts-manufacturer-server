# **CompParts Hub  (Server Side)**

## Parts Manufacturer Website

This is the backend server for the "CompParts Hub" MERN Stack project, a Parts Manufacturer website. This repository handles the server-side logic, including authentication, order management, and admin functionalities. The backend is built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, **JWT**, and **Stripe** for payment integration.

---

## Key Features

1. **Authentication**: Implemented using Firebase (email/password-based, social login with Google).
2. **JWT Protection**: JWT tokens are used to secure routes and restrict access based on user roles (Admin/User).
3. **User & Admin Dashboards**: Users can manage orders, leave reviews, and update profiles, while Admins can manage orders, products, and assign roles.
4. **Stripe Payment Integration**: Users can complete purchases using credit cards, with payments handled by Stripe.
5. **Parts Management**: Admins can add, update, and delete parts from the collection.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing parts, orders, users, and reviews.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Secures user and admin routes with token-based authentication.
- **Stripe API**: Manages payment processing for orders.
- **Firebase**: For authentication (email/password and Google login).

## Commits

This repository adheres to a structured commit message convention to enhance readability and maintainability. Here's an overview of the key commit types:

- **feat:** Introduces a new feature to the application.
- **fix:** Addresses a bug or issue identified in the codebase.
- **docs:** Encompasses changes made to documentation, such as updates, additions, or corrections.
- **style:** Covers formatting adjustments, whitespace changes, or fixing minor inconsistencies like missing semicolons.
- **refactor:** Represents code structure improvements without altering functionality. This can involve code organization, renaming variables or functions, or improving readability.
- **test:** Introduces new tests or updates existing tests to ensure code quality and maintainability.
- **chore:** Encompasses changes that don't directly affect the application's functionality, such as updating build tasks, package manager configurations, or dependency versions.

**Optional Improvement:**

Consider adopting a more comprehensive commit message convention like Conventional Commits ([https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)). This approach provides a standard format for commit messages, including type, scope (optional), and a clear description of the change, making it easier to generate changelogs, automate workflows, and collaborate effectively.
